office by the Commission on Judicial Performance, and must have met minimum age and years-
of-service requirements. Id. 1 4 (citing Gov't Code $ 75025). To remain in the program, a retired
judge must, at a minimum, "serve at least 25 days each fiscal year." Id. 1 5. Plaintiffs allege that
until May 21, 2018, there was no maximum limit on the number of days a retired judge could
participate in the TAJP. Id. 17.
On May 21, 2018, Defendants limited the number of days a retired judge can participate in
the TAJP to ,320-service days. FAC17. The FAC alleges that all plaintiffs have already
accumulated over 1,320-service days in the program. Id. 141 8-16.
According to Plaintiffs, the 1,320-day service limit prevents them from participating in the
TAJP under the same terms and conditions "as are applicable to younger judges." FAC11 16.
They allege that the 1,320-day service limit "has a disparate impact on plaintiffs and other
persons oftheir age" because they "will no longer be given assignments unless they receive an
exception' to the policy." Id. 1 24. Plaintiffs summarily allege the 1,320-day service limit "does
not apply to younger, more recently retired judges." Id. 1 26.
The FAC states two causes of action. Count One alleges unlawful disparate impact age
discrimination in violation of the FEHA. FAC130. Count Two alleges "Violation ofthe
California Constitution," claiming that the 1,320-day service limit violates sections 6(d) and 6(e)
of article VI of the California Constitution. Id. 111 33-34. Plaintiffs seek "back pay, front pay,
and other monetary relief," as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. See FAC at Prayer for
Relief.
B. The Court Denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction Because They
Failed to Show Some Possibility of Success on the Merits.
Shortly after filing the FAC, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to
enjoin Defendants from retroactively enforcing against them the 1,320-day service limit. See
Order Denying Pls. 9 Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ("Order") at 2:10-13. The Court denied Plaintiffs'
motion on July 10, 2019, finding that "Plaintiffs have failed to show a reasonable probability, or
at least some possibility, of prevailing on the merits of their claims.. ? Id. at 3:12-14.
The Court found, at the threshold, that the doctrine of legislative immunity barred all of
